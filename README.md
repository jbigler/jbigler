## About
My passion has been computer programming and art since the early 80s. My uncle gave me his old Vic-20, then I used my first after-school job to buy a Commodore 64. 
Since then I have kept up with the ever-changing technological landscape while pursuing various careers. Some of the work I've performed over the years includes:

- System administration 🖥
- Network administration 🕸
- Database administration 🗄
- Data analysis and report design 📊
- Desktop and web app development 🚞
- English teacher 👨‍🏫
- Early education program advisor 💼
- Digital and traditional media artist 🎨

I have always derived great pleasure from solving problems for clients through research and creative thinking.
In the late 90s I fell in love with the Ruby language, and later the Ruby on Rails framework, and greatly enjoy using it to create web applications to meet client needs. I believe in the importance of continuous learning and implementing best practices such as testing, version control, and working closely with others to create reliable software.

I am a citizen of the Unitest States currently residing in Hanoi, Vietnam 🍜 with my family.

## Objective
To secure a remote position that offers the opportunity to use my experience and technical know-how, as well as continue growing in knowledge and as a person.
